# RouteSpawns
[Link to the application](https://adansinacento.github.io/route-spawns/).    
When hunting on a route use this tool to keep track of how many different pokemon you have found and how many times you have encountered them, and get a percentage per species.

## How to use?
Use the text input to write the name of a pokemon you have encountered. This will automatically register the encounter, then whenever you encounter a pokemon from the same species just click the '+' button to increase the counter.

There is also a '-' button if you want to decrease the number and a remove button (its the red one with an 'X' on it) in case you want to completelly remove a pokemon from the encounters table.

## Possible improvements
There's a reason why this code is public and of course I encourage anyone to extend this to their needs, that being said there is a couple of features that I would like to (and probably will) implement for the tool in the future:

- Export/Import data from csv files
- create a settings panel to give the user some control over a few variables here and there.
